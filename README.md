# Paint-program
A simple paint program using Java programming language, OOP and SOLID principles. 
Different design patterns were used in the implementations. The painting process is mainly based on construction of different shapes and processing them. 
It was a team final project for Programming 2 course. I was responsible for the basic creation of shapes and functions such as copy, resize and fill.
